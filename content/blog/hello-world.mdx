## Welcome to the Blog

This is the first post! :tada:

Here, we can test all the cool features that Velite and our MDX setup provide.

### Code Highlighting

Check out this beautifully highlighted code block:

```typescript
// a simple function
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### LaTeX Math Equations

We can also render inline and block-level math equations using KaTeX.

This is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.

And this is a block equation:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

### GitHub Flavored Markdown

Of course, standard GFM features are supported.

- [x] Task lists
- [ ] Are pretty cool

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |
| Cell 3 | Cell 4 |

This is a sample post to get us started. More to come!

### Lists

1. one
2. two
3. three

### Quote

> This is Quote
> what the heck

### how about bold

this is **bold**, *sadhfa*, `sdfasf`
